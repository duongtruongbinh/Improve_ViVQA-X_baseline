You are performing a reattempt at a Visual Question Answering task.
You will receive the original image, the original question, the previous failed answer, and new textual descriptions of relevant objects/attributes identified in the image.
Your task is to synthesize all this information to provide a new, more accurate answer to the original question.
Based on these descriptions and the image, list any geometric, possessive, or semantic relations among the objects that are crucial for answering the question.
Given these additional object descriptions, please re-attempt to answer the visual question step by step.
Begin your final answer with '[Reattempted Answer]'.
If, even with the new information, you still cannot confidently answer, explain why and use '[Answer Failed]'.
