## Environment Prepare
Please refer to [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS). But do not use the official code, we modify the response function to obtain the confidence of the answer candidate. The source of LAVIS has been contained in this repo.

## LLM Results
### New LLM or new vqa dataset
We provide a unify api toolkit in api_tools/request_api_zoo.py, which support:
- Official OpenAI's server
- [Siliconflow](https://siliconflow.cn/zh-cn/)
- [Zhipu](https://open.bigmodel.cn/)
### Used LLM Results
Due to the update of LLM's API, we provide the middle results of the experiments we have conducted. You can download them from [GoogleDriver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sxj80Zs0KaQU1yZdx8oozjc8vMewwH7X/view?usp=sharing)

## Running
After setting the API key, or preparing the LLM results, you can run the framework via:

 ```bash
  bash run_gpt.sh
 ``` 
### Other Setting

- We use a multi-process to speed up the LLM revoke, you can modify the num of process in 'step_eval_multi_process_api_zoo.py'
- Download corresponding datasets and set the path in:  step_eval_mutil_process_api_zoo.py, test_for_integration_rights_alloction.py



## **TODO**
- ~~Release main framework code based on LAVIS~~
- ~~Release Corresponding middle results~~
- A more clear codebase with running README.md

## **Acknowledgement**
We heavily borrow the code from
[LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS),
 and [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). Thanks for sharing their code.
